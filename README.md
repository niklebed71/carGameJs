This is a simple JS game I made to understand the basic principles of game building. I left a lot of comments that helped me when writing the game.

Game rules. 
The goal of the game is to score the most points. 
Control the car with the arrow keys. 
When the car hits a coin, the player gets 1 point.
Each time the player scores three points, the game speeds up.
When the car hits a danger, the game ends. 
When the car hits an arrow, the speed speeds up for 1 sec. and hitting a danger for 1.5 sec. does not end the game.
